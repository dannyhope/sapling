# User Stories

## As a writer, I want to track changes to my document so I can see its evolution over time

### Scenarios
```gherkin
Scenario: Recording document changes
  Given I am editing text in the editor
  When I make changes to the text
  Then each edit should be automatically saved as a new version
  And the timeline should update to show the new version

Scenario: Viewing previous versions
  Given I have made several edits to my document
  When I click on a previous version in the timeline
  Then the editor should display the content from that version
  And the selected version should be highlighted in the timeline
```

**Tasks for testing:**
1. Ask users to write a short paragraph and observe if versions are created
2. Ask users to navigate back to a previous version and verify they understand what happened

## As a content creator, I want to create alternative versions (branches) of my document so I can explore different ideas

### Scenarios
```gherkin
Scenario: Creating a branch by editing from a previous version
  Given I have navigated to a previous version of my document
  When I make changes to the text at this point
  Then a new branch should be automatically created
  And the timeline should update to show the branching structure

Scenario: Naming a branch
  Given I want to create a named branch
  When I press Ctrl+B or Cmd+B
  And I enter a name for the branch
  Then a new branch with that name should be created from the current version
  And the timeline should update to show the named branch
```

**Tasks for testing:**
1. Ask users to go back to a previous version and make edits, then observe if they understand the branching behavior
2. Ask users to create a named branch and verify they can distinguish between branches

## As a team member, I want to share my document history with colleagues so we can collaborate on different versions

### Scenarios
```gherkin
Scenario: Exporting version history
  Given I have created multiple versions and branches of my document
  When I click the "Export History" button
  Then a JSON file containing all version history should be downloaded

Scenario: Importing version history
  Given I have a previously exported version history file
  When I click the "Import History" button
  And I select the history file
  Then all versions and branches from the file should be loaded
  And the timeline should update to show the imported structure
```

**Tasks for testing:**
1. Ask users to create a document with multiple versions, export it, and then import it into a new session
2. Ask users to share an exported history file with another user and have them import it

## As a user, I want to use keyboard shortcuts to navigate through my document history

### Scenarios
```gherkin
Scenario: Navigating to previous versions with keyboard
  Given I am viewing my document
  When I press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z
  Then the editor should display the previous version

Scenario: Navigating to next versions with keyboard
  Given I am viewing a previous version of my document
  When I press Ctrl+Shift+Z or Cmd+Shift+Z
  Then the editor should display the next version
```

**Tasks for testing:**
1. Ask users to navigate through their document history using only keyboard shortcuts
2. Observe if users discover the keyboard shortcuts without explicit instructions
