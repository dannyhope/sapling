/**
 * @file app-v2.js
 * @description Client-side text version control system - Version 2.
 *
 * This project implements a robust, modular, and well-documented text version control system
 * directly within the browser. It aims to provide a seamless experience for users to track
 * changes to text content, visualize version history, manage branches, and navigate
 * through different versions of their work.
 *
 * Core Functionality:
 * - Text Input Management: Captures granular text changes (single character typing and deletions)
 *   from a designated editor element.
 * - Version Creation: Records text states as distinct versions, utilizing a specialized
 *   `VersionContentStore` that maintains a history for each character slot in the document.
 *   This allows for a rich, character-level history (e.g., `['a', null, 'b']` for a character 'a'
 *   deleted and then replaced by 'b').
 * - History Visualization: Displays an interactive timeline of versions and branches (currently basic).
 * - Branch Management: (Scaffolded) Allows users to create, switch, and manage development branches.
 * - Version Navigation: (Scaffolded) Enables users to view and revert to previous text states.
 * - Data Persistence: Saves and loads version history and user preferences using local storage.
 *   File export/import is scaffolded.
 *
 * Architectural Principles:
 * - Object-Oriented Design (OOP): The system is built using classes to encapsulate
 *   responsibilities (EditorManagerV2, TimelineManagerV2, StorageManagerV2, VersionContentStore, VersionControlV2),
 *   promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
 * - Clear Separation of Concerns: Each class has a well-defined responsibility.
 *   `VersionContentStore` specifically handles the complex character-level data structure.
 * - Thorough Documentation: All classes, methods, and significant code blocks are documented
 *   using JSDoc to ensure clarity and ease of maintenance.
 * - Best Practices: Adherence to modern JavaScript best practices, including strict mode,
 *   efficient DOM manipulation, and robust error handling.
 * - Extensibility: Designed with future enhancements in mind (e.g., complex branching, merging,
 *   more sophisticated timeline, handling of multi-character changes like paste).
 * - User Experience: Focus on providing an intuitive and responsive user interface for core operations.
 *
 * Expected Code Quality:
 * - Readability: Code should be clean, well-formatted, and easy to understand.
 * - Maintainability: Modular design and comprehensive documentation facilitate ongoing maintenance and updates.
 * - Robustness: Includes error handling and validation to ensure stability.
 * - Efficiency: Optimized for performance where critical, especially in DOM manipulation and data processing related to text input.
