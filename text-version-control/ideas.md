# Ideas for Text Version Control

## Frameworks that could help
- Diff-Match-Patch library for better text diffing
- D3.js for more advanced timeline visualization
- IndexedDB for more robust local storage of version history

## Existing tools that do what we're building
- Git (command-line version control)
- Etherpad's timeline feature
- Google Docs version history
- Notion's version history

## Architecture improvements
- Implement a proper Command pattern for better undo/redo operations
- Use a more efficient data structure for storing versions (compressed diffs instead of full content)
- Implement server-side storage for persistent history across devices

## Patterns that might help
- Observer pattern for real-time updates to the timeline when edits are made
- Memento pattern for storing and restoring editor states
- Composite pattern for representing the branch tree structure

## Tools that could help
- Jest for unit testing the version control logic
- Cypress for end-to-end testing of the UI
- Webpack for bundling and optimizing the application
- TypeScript for better type safety and code organization
