# Technical Debt

## Current Issues

ðŸ”´ Timeline visualization needs improvement for complex branch structures
- The current rendering logic doesn't handle deep nested branches well
- Lines connecting branches could be more visually clear

ðŸ”´ Performance optimization for large documents
- Current implementation stores full document content for each version
- Should implement diff-based storage to reduce memory usage

ðŸ”´ Local storage limitations
- Browser local storage has size limits that could be reached with large documents
- Need to implement a more robust storage solution (IndexedDB)

ðŸ”´ Lack of proper error handling
- Need to add try/catch blocks around critical operations
- Should provide user-friendly error messages

ðŸ”´ Missing automated tests
- No unit or integration tests for core functionality
- Makes refactoring risky

ðŸ”´ Limited accessibility
- Keyboard shortcuts need ARIA labels
- Timeline navigation should be fully keyboard accessible

ðŸ”´ Mobile support is limited
- UI is not fully responsive
- Touch interactions for timeline navigation need improvement
